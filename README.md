# Stage 1: I AM / Eternal Witness <a name="stage1"></a>

## Self-Inquiry

- "Who am I?"
- "Before birth, who am I?"
- "Who / what am I beyond name and form?"
- "Who is dragging this corpse along?"
- "Who hears and who sees?"

# Stage 2: I AM Everything <a name="stage2"></a>

## Contemplation

- “Where does awareness end and manifestation begin?”
- “Is there a border/dividing line between awareness and manifestation?”

### Four aspects of I AM

- Impersonality
- Intensity of luminosity
- Dissolving the need to return or abide in I AM
- Effortlessness

# Stage 3: Entering into Nothingness <a name="stage3"></a>

## Dropping

- Drop away everything (knowledge, mind, body, etc).

# Stage 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity <a name="stage4"></a>

## Contemplation

- Meditation and contemplation on [Bahiya Sutta](#bahiya-sutta)
- Contemplation on [Thusness Stanzas](#thusness-stanzas)
- “Is there a border/dividing line between awareness and manifestation?”
- “Where does awareness end and manifestation begin?”

### Four aspects of I AM

## Investigation
- Challenging inside/outside, subject/object dichotomy
- Investigating seamless awareness and manifestation

# Stage 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”) <a name="stage5"></a>

## Contemplation

- Meditation and contemplation on [Bahiya Sutta](#bahiya-sutta)
- Contemplation on [Thusness Stanzas](#thusness-stanzas)

## Investigation

- Investigate and challenge all sense of awareness being unchanging and independent

# Stage 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”) <a name="stage6"></a>

## Total Exertion (+A)

### Contemplation

- > When you cook, there is no self that cooks, only the activity of cooking. The hands moves, the utensils act, the water boils, the potatoes peels… here there is no room for simplicity or complications, the “kitchen” went beyond its own imputation and dissolved into the activity of cooking and the universe is fully engaged in this cooking.
- Contemplate "not meeting yet connected" of total exertion and dependent origination
- Contemplation on the totality of each activity

## Emptiness (-A)

### Contemplation

- Contemplation on the ‘Where’ of phenomena
- "This moment ceases as it arises, is this moment arising or ceasing?”
- "30 years of practice and 23 years of kitchen life is like a passing thought. How heavy is this thought? The whereabouts of this thought? Taste the nature of this thought. It never truly arises." - John Tan, 2013

# Stage 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected <a name="stage7"></a>

## Contemplation

>Anatta is a seal, not a stage.\
>Awareness has always been non-dual.\
>Appearances have always been Non-arising.\
>All phenomena are ‘interconnected’ and by nature Maha.\
>All are always and already so.

# Additional Materials <a name="additional-materials"></a>

## Bahiya Sutta <a name="bahiya-sutta"></a>

> Then, Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus:\
> In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen.\
> In reference to the heard, only the heard.\
> In reference to the sensed, only the sensed.\
> In reference to the cognized, only the cognized.\
> That is how you should train yourself.\
> When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen,\
> only the heard in reference to the heard,\
> only the sensed in reference to the sensed,\
> only the cognized in reference to the cognized,\
> then, Bāhiya, there is no you in connection with that.\
> When there is no you in connection with that,\
> there is no you there.\
> When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two.\
> This, just this, is the end of stress."
